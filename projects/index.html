                        (MRC)</a> is the first large project I have taken up on my own. Using knowledge I gained in and
                    outside of class, I decided to try and solve a problem I found myself facing when I was trying to
                    pick a record from my record collection that I wanted to listen to; I could not decide from my
                    collection what record I was in the mood to hear. I found my collection of around 70 records to be
                    quite daunting when I wanted to listen to music. Sometimes I would even just give up and do
                    something else. What I wished for was an app where I could see all my records and sort them by their
                    genres and my own personal rating that I had for them. And if you know much about musicâ€”no, Discogs
                    is not quite what I was looking for. However, I eventually integrated it into my app in a way.</p>
                <p>I had just finished my first term of third year and in my CS3307: Objected-Oriented Design and
                    Analysis course, we were tasked with coming up with our own idea for a software and making it in
                    C++. We came across the Qt development framework and used it to make an (admittedly not very great)
                    music player with playlists and a queue called Spotishy. So, during the winter reading week, I got
                    to work to solve my problem using Qt. I had a rough idea of what I wanted it to do. It should be
                    able to search and find any record using an API, I used last.fm. It should be able to save and
                    record from last.fm locally. The user should be able to give these local records a rating out of 10
                    and any tag that they want. Finally, the user should be able to sort the collection by those ratings
                    and tags.

                                version of the app. It got the basics of what I wanted it to be able to do down. Adding
                                record, tags, and ratings. I found myself actually wanting to use the app to pick what
                                to listen to and I even started listening to my records more. I considered it a success.

                    adjustments here and there that I wanted that didn't feel major. I made some performance
                    improvements through threading and grouping elements, I added a loading animation for album covers,
                    I improved the "sort by" dropdown to be less confusing, and finally I made a few big fixes.</p>

                    analysis/graphing feature to show a user's collection in another way kind of Spotify Wrapped-esque
                    because I especially like currently being able to see how many records of each genre I have as I
                    find it interesting. I also think it would be really cool if the app was able to be an online
                    service
                    that had user data stored in the cloud, and you could sign in to it from any device and it synced
                    across devices, but that's for v2.0.0 if it ever comes to fruition.

                <div class="subheading mb-3">Languages and Skills: Python, Excel, Data Analysis</div>
                <p>During end of my third year, I started regularly going to the gym on campus. I eventually learned
                    that the staff there post updates about their live usage stats every 30 minutes. After initially
                    finding it difficult to tell whether 80 people meant busy or not because I had to frame of reference
                    for that number, I thought I would write a script to scrape as much of their tweet data as possible
                    and then graph it.</p>
                <p>At first I found it difficult to get the data from Twitter due to the API changes they made changing
                    the free tier of their API to have no access to pulling tweets, instead requiring a $100USD/month
                    subscription to do that. To get around that, I first tried using JS package, rettiwt, which was only
                    able to get me the most recent page of tweets and not the next, so I could only get about 20. When
                    the Rec was posting more than 20 tweets a day, that wasn't super useful. Instead, I tried a Python
                    package Tweety-ns. It is a reverse engineered front-end API that uses a web-client sign-in. It was
                    able to get me the most recent 800 tweets which was good enough for my use.</p>
                <p>Over time, as I learned more, I improved my code and ran it once a month to keep the data up to date.
                    I currently have collected <a href="assets/RecOutput.txt" target="_blank">over 5000 data points</a>
                    from May 2nd, 2024 onward and I am currently working on developing a linear regression machine
                    learning model to predict usage for the rest of the day based on the current attendance. You can
                    check out my code, data, and full Excel spreadsheet on my Github <a

                    Teamwork</div>
                <p>For the class project of CS4471: Requirement Analysis in my fourth year, my group was tasked with
                    creating a microservice-based system that would operate in a cloud environment. For this project, we
                    were required to create a service registry that manages service registrations and maintains an
                    inventory of available services, a service consumer (a front-end application) that enables users to
                    discover registered services through a GUI, and multiple services designed as loosely coupled and
                    independently deployable microservices capable of communicate with the registry through HTTP, AMQP,
                    or gRPC. You can view the <a href="assets/4471_Project_Desc.pdf" target="_blank">project description
                        here</a>.</p>
                <p>We decided to code our registry with Node.JS, use MySQL for its database, AWS for cloud hosting, and
                    HTTP requests to enable communication between the registry and services. We then had to identify
                    functional, quality, and architecturally significant requirements (ASRs) of the registry and each
                    service to guide our approach in developing the system's architecture. I was assigned to create
                    the architecture diagrams, identify ASRs, and implement the registry and the first two
                    microservices. As part of my implementation, I provided a Node.JS file to help my groupmates easily
                    connect their services to the registry. <a href="assets/4471_Final_Report.pdf" target="_blank">Find

                            <h3>Overall System Architecture</h3>
                            <p>Our system architecture consisted of three modules: one for the microservices, one for
                                the registry, and one for the registry database. The microservice modules would be able
                                to send heartbeats to the registry every 15 seconds, letting it know the microservice
                                remained available, send register or deregister requests to the registry, and provide a
                                unique function for the user.</p>
                            <p>For the backend the registry processed those POST requests made by the microservices and
                                ensured the database remained up to date. If it did not receive a heartbeat from a
                                microservice for 35 seconds, it would mark the microservice as unavailable. For the
                                front end, the registry provided a GUI for users as a webpage along with another method
                                to fetch the currently registered microservices. The webpage would use this information
                                to update its list every few seconds.</p>
                            <p class="mb-0">The final module, the database, was implemented with MySQL and stored all
                                necessary information about each registered microservice, such as the ID, name, URL,
                                status, and timestamp of the last heartbeat.</p>

                    to make a website for a record store.</p>
                <p class="mb-0">Some of the requirements for the site were as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Single page</li>
                    <li>Enhanced parallax</li>

                    used the Atlassian suite of software.</p>
                <p>For the project, we needed to create a geographic information system (GIS) covering three buildings
                    on campus. The system needed to include premade informational POIs on the map as well as
                    functionality for user-created POIs. We were required to use Java and were encouraged to use
                    NetBeans for its drag-and-drop UI creator. Additionally, we wrote unit tests for the code using
