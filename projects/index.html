                        (MRC)</a> is the first large project I have taken up on my own. Using knowledge I gained in and
                    outside of class, I decided to try and solve a problem I found myself facing when I was trying to
                    pick a record from my record collection that I wanted to listen to; I could not decide from my
                    collection what record I was in the mood to hear. I found my collection of around 70 records to be
                    quite daunting when I wanted to listen to music. Sometimes I would even just give up and do
                    something else. What I wished for was an app where I could see all my records and sort them by their
                    genres and my own personal rating that I had for them. And if you know much about musicâ€”no, Discogs
                    is not quite what I was looking for. However, I eventually integrated it into my app in a way.</p>
                <p>I had just finished my first term of third year and in my CS3307: Objected-Oriented Design and
                    Analysis course, we were tasked with coming up with our own idea for a software and making it in
                    C++. We came across the Qt development framework and used it to make an (admittedly not very great)
                    music player with playlists and a queue called Spotishy. So, during the winter reading week, I got
                    to work to solve my problem using Qt. I had a rough idea of what I wanted it to do. It should be
                    able to search and find any record using an API, I used last.fm. It should be able to save and
                    record from last.fm locally. The user should be able to give these local records a rating out of 10
                    and any tag that they want. Finally, the user should be able to sort the collection by those ratings
                    and tags.

                                version of the app. It got the basics of what I wanted it to be able to do down. Adding
                                record, tags, and ratings. I found myself actually wanting to use the app to pick what
                                to listen to and I even started listening to my records more. I considered it a success.

                    adjustments here and there that I wanted that didn't feel major. I made some performance
                    improvements through threading and grouping elements, I added a loading animation for album covers,
                    I improved the "sort by" dropdown to be less confusing, and finally I made a few big fixes.</p>

                    analysis/graphing feature to show a user's collection in another way kind of Spotify Wrapped-esque
                    because I especially like currently being able to see how many records of each genre I have as I
                    find it interesting. I also think it would be really cool if the app was able to be an online
                    service
                    that had user data stored in the cloud, and you could sign in to it from any device and it synced
                    across devices, but that's for v2.0.0 if it ever comes to fruition.

                    During end of my third year, I started regularly going to the gym on campus. I eventually learned
                    that the staff post live attendance updates every 30 minutes on Twitter. After initially
                    finding it difficult to tell whether 80 in the weight room meant busy or not as I had no prior frame
                    of reference, I thought I would write a script to scrape as much of their tweet data as possible
                    and then graph it. With the python package I was using, I could scrape the most recent ~800 tweets.
                    Running this once a month for 8 months, I accumulated <a href="assets/RecOutput.txt"

                                model because it took every data point for each day of the week and hour and then simply
                                averaged them together. This is the data I was most interested in initially as it helped
                                me pick the best day and time to go to the gym. Looking back, I probably could have just
                                googled "what day is the gym least busy?" but that's beside the point. I ended up
                                picking early afternoon on Sundays. I also had charts for each month separately so I
                                could see how different months were more or less busy.</p>

                    Quickly, I realized I wanted to do more with the data I was accumulating. So, for my AI 2 final
                    project, I challenged myself to learn about recurrent neural networks and create a long short-term
                    memory (LSTM) model that could perform time series prediction and forecast how many people there
                    would be at the gym on any given day. It would do this by taking as input the previous five hours of
                    attendance readings and then predict each hour's attendance for the rest of the day.

                    During my research and development, I discovered a previous student's attempt at solving my problem,
                    which they referred to as <a href="https://x.com/westerngymbot" target="_blank">GyMBRo</a>, AKA Gym
                    Monitoring By Robot. Clever name. Every day this bot would post a morning forecast graph on Twitter
                    and, throughout the day, fetch tweets from the Rec Centre and plot those points to the graph. The
                    issue I had with this implementation is that it did not adjust its prediction throughout the day,
                    say if the gym were abnormally busy, which I planned to have mine do via inputting of the five
                    points to make the forecast from. GyMBRo did, however, give me a good comparison for my forecasts
                    and, when I found its source code, an additional 7 years of attendance data (50 000 tuples) to help
                    with model training. Because good LSTM models are known to be very dependent on training with lots
                    of data, I knew this was a big win. Thanks Demetri!

                    While keeping things concise here on my site, I engineered my labeled tuples to consist of 5
                    features: the month (1-12), the week (0-52), the day (1-31), the hour (0-23), and the day of the
                    week (0-6). The label was the number of people in the weight room. This label would also be a
                    feature when put back into the model to get the next prediction. I also added ~1000 tuples to my
                    dataset with labels of '0' for then the gym was closed. After feature engineering, I took 80% of the
                    days and saved them for training, 10% for validation, and the remaining 10% for testing. I then used
                    PyTorch to train my LSTM model. I trained 100 epochs for each different variation of hyperparameters
                    and saved the one with the best validation MSE. Then I chose the hyperparameter combination with
                    the best test MSE. I ended up creating a model with a test MSE of 541.6. This is
                    noticeably better than the MSE of my simple day of the week average model, which had a MSE of 752.2
                    on the same test dataset. For more in-depth background information, methodology, results, and

                    After concluding my research, I learned lots about what it takes to create an AI model,
                    the necessary steps needed to format training and testing data, and how to communicate my findings.
                    Ultimately, I considered my model a success. It preformed better than my previous attempts of simply
                    averaging previous
                    days' data and, often, I found the model to preform better the GyMBRo model. I did not find the
                    model's performance at forecasting at the start of the day to be very
                    accurate, before any attendance observations have been made. I think the model could be improved by
                    adding more features, specifically for upcoming holidays and open/closed hours. As well, perhaps
                    combining two models for a forecast would be beneficial. Using a different architecture to make a
                    morning forecast could counteract the underestimating morning problem.

                <p>For the class project of CS4471: Requirement Analysis in my fourth year, my group was tasked with
                    creating a microservice-based system that would operate in a cloud environment. For this project, we
                    were required to create a service registry that manages service registrations and maintains an
                    inventory of available services, a service consumer (a front-end application) that enables users to
                    discover registered services through a GUI, and multiple services designed as loosely coupled and
                    independently deployable microservices capable of communicate with the registry through HTTP, AMQP,
                    or gRPC. You can view the <a href="assets/4471_Project_Desc.pdf" target="_blank">project description
                        here</a>.</p>
                <p>We decided to code our registry with Node.JS, use MySQL for its database, AWS for cloud hosting, and
                    HTTP requests to enable communication between the registry and services. We then had to identify
                    functional, quality, and architecturally significant requirements (ASRs) of the registry and each
                    service to guide our approach in developing the system's architecture. I was assigned to create
                    the architecture diagrams, identify ASRs, and implement the registry and the first two
                    microservices. As part of my implementation, I provided a Node.JS file to help my groupmates easily
                    connect their services to the registry. <a href="assets/4471_Final_Report.pdf" target="_blank">Find

                            <p>Our system architecture consisted of three modules: one for the microservices, one for
                                the registry, and one for the registry database. The microservice modules would be able
                                to send heartbeats to the registry every 15 seconds, letting it know the microservice
                                remained available, send register or deregister requests to the registry, and provide a
                                unique function for the user.</p>
                            <p>For the backend the registry processed those POST requests made by the microservices and
                                ensured the database remained up to date. If it did not receive a heartbeat from a
                                microservice for 35 seconds, it would mark the microservice as unavailable. For the
                                front end, the registry provided a GUI for users as a webpage along with another method
                                to fetch the currently registered microservices. The webpage would use this information
                                to update its list every few seconds.</p>
                            <p class="mb-0">The final module, the database, was implemented with MySQL and stored all
                                necessary information about each registered microservice, such as the ID, name, URL,
                                status, and timestamp of the last heartbeat.</p>

                <p>The final project of CS2033: Multimedia & Communication II in my fourth year required us to
                    individually create a responsive, interactive, informative, and attractive website for a fake
                    business of our choice. As you might have guessed by now, I am an avid record collector, so I chose
                    to make a website for a record store.</p>
                <p class="mb-0">Some of the requirements for the site were as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Single page</li>
                    <li>Enhanced parallax</li>
                    <li>ScrollFire</li>
                    <li>Day specific messages</li>
                    <li>CSS animation</li>
                    <li>CSS transition</li>
                    <li>Tiled background</li>
                    <li>Back to top button</li>
                    <li>At least 4 products</li>
                    <li>Form modification and validation</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I learned a lot from this course and its prerequisite, lessons I have applied to create this site
                    showcasing myself and my projects.</p>

                    Teamwork</div>
                <p>For CS2212: Introduction to Software Engineering in my second year, I participated in my first
                    computer science group project. It was my first experience coding on a team, requiring us to develop
                    a unified idea of a codebase and deal with version control collaboratively. To stay organized, we
                    used the Atlassian suite of software.</p>
                <p>For the project, we needed to create a geographic information system (GIS) covering three buildings
                    on campus. The system needed to include premade informational POIs on the map as well as
                    functionality for user-created POIs. We were required to use Java and were encouraged to use
                    NetBeans for its drag-and-drop UI creator. Additionally, we wrote unit tests for the code using
                    JUnit.</p>

                                <p>This is how our project appeared when a user selected a user-created POI and chose to
                                    edit it. You can see on the right all of the POI's data fields that you could
                                    change, and below that, the current weather on campus. Additionally, the right panel
                                    (not shown) included options to toggle different layers of POIs and a user favorites
                                    list.</p>
                                <p class="mb-0">In the middle-top section, you can see a list of all existing POIs, and
                                    below that is information about the selected POI. On the left, you have the map,
                                    which you can scroll around to view the entire floor.</p>
