            During end of my third year, I started regularly going to the gym on
            campus. I eventually learned that the staff post live attendance
            updates every 30 minutes on Twitter. After initially finding it
            difficult to interpret the posts as busy or not, I thought I would
            write a script to scrape as much information from their tweets as
            possible and graph it. With the python package I was using, I could
            scrape the most recent ~800 tweets. Only able to scrape up to ~800
            tweets in the past, I run the script once a month for 8 months and
            accumulated
            <a href="assets/RecOutput.txt" target="_blank"
              >over 5000 datapoints</a

                  I referred to this dataset as my day of the week average model
                  because it took every data point for each day of the week and
                  hour and then simply averaged them together. This data helped
                  me pick the best day and time to go to the gym, mid-day
                  Sunday. Looking back, I probably could have just googled "what
                  day is the gym least busy?" but where's the fun in that?

            Quickly, I realized I wanted to do more with the data I was
            accumulating. So, for my AI 2 final project, I challenged myself to
            learn about recurrent neural networks and create a long short-term
            memory (LSTM) model that could perform time series prediction and
            forecast how many people there would be at the gym on any given day.
            It would do this by taking as input the previous five hours of
            attendance readings and then predict each hour's attendance for the
            rest of the day.

            During my research, I discovered a previous student's attempt at
            solving my problem, which they called
            <a href="https://x.com/westerngymbot" target="_blank">GyMBRo</a>,
            AKA Gym Monitoring By Robot. Clever name. Every day this bot would
            post a forecast on Twitter. The issue I had with this implementation
            is that it did not adjust its prediction throughout the day. I
            planned to have mine do this via the inputting of five points to
            make the forecast from. GyMBRo did, however, give me a good
            comparison for my forecasts and an additional 7 years of attendance
            data (50 000 tuples) to help with model training. Very useful
            because LSTM models are known to be very dependent on large training
            sets. Thanks Demetri!
          </p>
          <p>
            Keeping things concise here on my site, I engineered my labeled
            tuples to consist of 5 features: the month (1-12), the week (0-52),
            the day (1-31), the hour (0-23), and the day of the week (0-6). The
            label was the number of people in the weight room. This label would
            also be a feature when used for making the next prediction. I also
            added tuples for when the gym was closed. After feature engineering,
            I separated 80% of the days for training, 10% for validation, and
            the remaining 10% for testing. I then used PyTorch to train my LSTM
            model. I tried several different hyperparameter tunings and trained
            100 epochs for each variation of hyperparameters, saving the one
            with the best mean squared error (MSE) on the validation set. I
            ended up creating a model with a test MSE of 541.6. This is
            noticeably better than the MSE of my simple day of the week average
            model, which had a MSE of 752.2 on the same dataset. For more
            in-depth background information, methodology, results, and
            conclusions of my research, find my

            After concluding my research, I learned lots about what it takes to
            create an AI model, the necessary steps needed to format training
            and testing data, and how to communicate my findings. Ultimately, I
            considered my model a success. It preformed better than my previous
            attempts of forecasting by averaging days' data, and, often, I found
            the model to preform better the GyMBRo model. I did not find the
            model's performance at forecasting from the start of the day to be
            very accurate. I think the model could be improved by adding more
            features, specifically for upcoming holidays and open/closed hours.
            As well, perhaps combining two models for a forecast would be
            beneficial. Using a different architecture to make a morning
            forecast could counteract the underestimating morning problem.

            Using knowledge I gained in and outside of class, I solved a problem
            I found myself facing when I wanted to listen to music; I could not
            decide what record from my vinyl collection I was in the mood to
            hear. I found my collection of only around 70 records to be quite
            daunting to pick from. So much so that sometimes I would skip trying
            to play a record altogether. What I wished for was an app where I
            could see all my records easily and sort them by their genres and
            other attributes I wanted for them.
          </p>
          <p>
            I solved my problem by creating My Record Collection v1, but after
            using it for a while, I realized that I wanted something better. I
            wanted to improve the user experience, connect it to a backend
            server, add more features, and make the app more visually appealing.
            Feeling a bit limited with Qt, I decided to completely rebuild the
            app using React and TypeScript with the MUI library, allowing for a
            more dynamic, responsive, and attractive user interface that could
            be used across devices. I also wanted to integrate a backend using
            Node.js and Express, with a MySQL database to store user data and
            records. With that goal, I created
            <a href="https://myrecordcollection.app" target="_blank"
              >My Record Collection v2.</a

                  This is the updated collection view with an improved layout
                  and a familiar MUI design. It allows for completly
                  customizable and fast filtering, sorting, and searching. Users
                  can search and add records to add to one of their collections
                  from the Last.FM database with custom tags, ratings, and
                  reviews. They can also see what other users have rated and
                  reviewed the record.

            After recreating the basic functions from the first version of the
            app (adding, editing, filtering, and sorting records, suggested tags
            for records, and importing Discogs collections), I focused on
            improving the user experience and developing new features. I knew I
            wanted a wishlist feature, as I often found myself wanting to keep
            track of albums I wanted to buy in the future in one place. I also
            knew I wanted to add public profiles, because now that the app was
            web-based, I wanted to be able to share my collection and see the
            collections of my friends. These new features snowballed into even
            more new features, I definately understand scope creep quite a bit
            better now. I created a feed to see recent friend activity, users
            can create their own lists of record to share and like others'
            lists, and each user has statistics constantly kept up-to-date in
            the backend that tracks the genre makeup of their records and the
            average rating of each genre. User's can view their own stats and
            compare their collection and stats with others.

            >
            was my first major personal project. I had just finished CS3307:
            Objected-Oriented Design and Analysis, where we were tasked to come
            up with our own idea for a software and make it with C++. We came
            across the Qt framework and used it to make an crude music player
            with playlists and a queue. With this new knowledge, I set out to
            solve my problem by using Qt during reading week. I had a rough idea
            of what I wanted it to do. It should be able to search and find any
            record (using an API), save the record to a collection with user
            defined tags and ratings, and the user should be able to sort the
            collection by those tags and ratings.

                  This is the first (mostly) working version of what I created.
                  It got the basics of what I wanted it to be able to do down.
                  Adding record, tags, and ratings. I found myself actually
                  wanting to use the app to pick what to listen to and I even
                  started listening to my records more. I considered it a
                  success.

            Over the course of about half a year I continued to make incremental
            updates to the app with feedback from friends that saw and used the
            app, and of course adding things I wanted from the app. Below are
            features I added with each minor version increment.

            After v1.4.0, I felt like I was mostly "done" so I spent some time
            figuring out how to compile the app on a Mac so I could give my Mac
            user friends a version they could use. Plus, I made some minor
            adjustments here and there that I wanted that didn't feel major. I
            made some performance improvements through increased multithreading
            and I added an album cover loading animation, among other bug fixes
            and improvements.

            For the class project of CS4471: Requirement Analysis in my fourth
            year, my group was tasked with creating a microservice-based system
            that would operate in a cloud environment. For this project, we were
            required to create a service registry that manages service
            registrations and maintains an inventory of available services, a
            service consumer (a front-end application) that enables users to
            discover registered services through a GUI, and multiple services
            designed as loosely coupled and independently deployable
            microservices capable of communicate with the registry through HTTP,
            AMQP, or gRPC. You can view the
            <a href="assets/4471_Project_Desc.pdf" target="_blank"
              >project description here</a
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            We decided to code our registry with Node.JS, use MySQL for its
            database, AWS for cloud hosting, and HTTP requests to enable
            communication between the registry and services. We then had to
            identify functional, quality, and architecturally significant
            requirements (ASRs) of the registry and each service to guide our
            approach in developing the system's architecture. I was assigned to
            create the architecture diagrams, identify ASRs, and implement the
            registry and the first two microservices. As part of my
            implementation, I provided a Node.JS file to help my groupmates
            easily connect their services to the registry.

                <h3>Overall System Architecture</h3>
                <p>
                  Our system architecture consisted of three modules: one for
                  the microservices, one for the registry, and one for the
                  registry database. The microservice modules would be able to
                  send heartbeats to the registry every 15 seconds, letting it
                  know the microservice remained available, send register or
                  deregister requests to the registry, and provide a unique
                  function for the user.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For the backend the registry processed those POST requests
                  made by the microservices and ensured the database remained up
                  to date. If it did not receive a heartbeat from a microservice
                  for 35 seconds, it would mark the microservice as unavailable.
                  For the front end, the registry provided a GUI for users as a
                  webpage along with another method to fetch the currently
                  registered microservices. The webpage would use this
                  information to update its list every few seconds.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-0">
                  The final module, the database, was implemented with MySQL and
                  stored all necessary information about each registered
                  microservice, such as the ID, name, URL, status, and timestamp
                  of the last heartbeat.
                </p>

            The final project of CS2033: Multimedia & Communication II in my
            fourth year required us to individually create a responsive,
            interactive, informative, and attractive website for a fake business
            of our choice. As you might have guessed by now, I am an avid record
            collector, so I chose to make a website for a record store.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-0">
            Some of the requirements for the site were as follows:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Single page</li>
            <li>Enhanced parallax</li>
            <li>ScrollFire</li>
            <li>Day specific messages</li>
            <li>CSS animation</li>
            <li>CSS transition</li>
            <li>Tiled background</li>
            <li>Back to top button</li>
            <li>At least 4 products</li>
            <li>Form modification and validation</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I learned a lot from this course and its prerequisite, lessons I
            have applied to create this site showcasing myself and my projects.

            For CS2212: Introduction to Software Engineering in my second year,
            I participated in my first computer science group project. It was my
            first experience coding on a team, requiring us to develop a unified
            idea of a codebase and deal with version control collaboratively. To
            stay organized, we used the Atlassian suite of software.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the project, we needed to create a geographic information system
            (GIS) covering three buildings on campus. The system needed to
            include premade informational POIs on the map as well as
            functionality for user-created POIs. We were required to use Java
            and were encouraged to use NetBeans for its drag-and-drop UI
            creator. Additionally, we wrote unit tests for the code using JUnit.

                    and below that, the current weather on campus. Additionally,
                    the right panel (not shown) included options to toggle
                    different layers of POIs and a user favorites list.

                    selected POI. On the left, you have the map, which you can
