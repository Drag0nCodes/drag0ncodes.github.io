                        Western Ontario pursuing a focus in software engineering.</b>
                </p>
                <p class="lead">Solving problems and learning things with a passion.</p>
                <p class="lead">This is the philosophy I have stuck with for my education. Since beginning my journey in
                    computer science in high school, I've been driven by my desire to simplify and improve life with
                    tech. What started as a curiosity grew into an endless pursuit of harnessing the opportunities that
                    software engineering offers.</p>
                <p class="lead mb-4">My approach has always been iterative: encounter a problem, learn new skills, apply
                    them, and repeat. My philosophy has garnered me with a range of technical skills, including C, C++,
                    Python, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, SQL, and Git. I thrive on using these skills I've
                    learned to create solutions to the problems I face. Whether working on my own or as part of a team,
                    I find every challenge is an opportunity to grow.</p>

                <p>Apart from coding, I enjoy spending as much time as I can outdoors. Hiking, biking, and playing
                    tennis in the summer and skiing in the winter. You can catch me biking the paths of the Thames
                    Valley Parkway most weeks trying to meet my goal of 1500km for the third year in a row.</p>
                <p class="mb-0">When forced indoors, I love to spend my free time rock climbing or learning new coding
                    skills. Recently I have been coding an application that allows a user to easily sort their vinyl
                    record
                    collection and pick what they want to listen to next. See it on the projects page <a
